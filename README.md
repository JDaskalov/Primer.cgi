# Primer.cgi
Individual Project 1

Set up github repository and copied simple.cgi from the CSUN servers.
Experimented with some code for style sheets.
Used curl to display the csun website
Display the list of environment variables with the query_string

The project was completed to the best of my current abilities and understanding of the instructions.
I was able to display environment variables, used the query_string and recovered data from the internet.
I wasn't able to get a style sheet working unfortunately.
